## Features

- Fully 3D Printed Modular Split Flap Display with 37 or 48 Characters Per Module
- Small Size, 8 Modules are 320mm, 3 Modules are 130mm Wide. 80mm tall (original version) or 94mm (extended version) tall
- Fully configurable and controllable via Web Interface
    - Switch Between Operation Modes, modes include custom input, date mode, and time mode
    - Configure WiFi, Timezone, and hardware settings
    - Module calibration interface for precise alignment
- MQTT Support with automatic reconnection
- OTA Firmware / Filesystem updating

## Recent Enhancements

- **Module Calibration**: Web-based offset adjustment for precise character alignment

<sub>\* Requires manually resetting the board into firmware upload mode by holding BOOT, pressing & releasing RESET, then releasing BOOT prior to upload. After uploading is successful, either press & release RESET or power cycle the board to put it in normal operation mode.</sub>

## Setup Instructions

1. Install dependencies
    - [PlatformIO Core CLI](https://platformio.org/install/cli)
    - [Node Version Mananger](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
    - [ClangFormat](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) (Only required if contributing code)
1. [Download](https://github.com/jhoff/Split-Flap-Display/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or clone this [git repository](https://github.com/jhoff/Split-Flap-Display).
1. Open a terminal and `cd` to the project root
1. Install required version of npm for the project - `nvm install`
1. Install build dependencies - `npm install`
1. Connect the ESP32 to your computer using a USB cable.
1. Build everything and upload to the board - `npm run build`

- Automatically formats all source code ( `npm run format` - if needed )
- Compiles and minifies all frontend assets ( `npm run assets` )
- Downloads all required arduino / esp32 libraries
- Compiles and uploads the esp32 firmware ( `npm run pio:firmware` or `pio run -t upload -e <environment>` )
- Compiles and uploads the littlefs filesystem ( `npm run pio:filesystem` or `pio run -t uploadfs -e <environment>` )

1. Enjoy!

### Using OTA to update the firmware

On the settings page set an OTA password to enable OTA updatable firmware. Use this same password for your `auth` flag in `platformio.ini`, and then use a device environment with `*_ota` appended (ie `esp32_s3_ota`) to upload a new firmware and/or filesystem
